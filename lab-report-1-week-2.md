## Introduction 

Hello there! Welcome to my Lab report 1 for CSE 15L. This page contains tutorials on:
* Installing VS code
* Remotely Connecting 
* Trying Some Commands
* Moving Files with scp
* Setting an SSH Key
* Optimizing Remote Running


## Installing Vscode
_This tutorial assumes that you have a java (13 or newer) already installed on your machine._

**Step 1:** Go on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and click the Mac Download button

**Step 2:** Open the file and keep following the instructions that the system prompts.

**Step 3:** Open VS code. 

**Step 4:** Open up command palette (Shift + Command  + P), or click view --> Command Palette from the top bar.

Step 5. Type "Install 'Code' command in PATH." Then hit enter. 
Step 6. Open terminal and type:

`$ code <filename>.java`

So, you can say for instance type:

`$ code HelloWorld.java`

**Step 7:** Open VS code, go on terminal. Atlernatively, you can also type in the terminal:

`$ code` 

**Step 8:** Click File > New File 

**Step 9:** Type the following code into your file and hit Command + S:

``class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
} ``

Step 10: Open terminal and type 
`$ javac HelloWorld.java `

`$ java HelloWorld `

**Troubleshooting**

 If your mac not let you open the file since you downloaded it from the internet, you would need to allow the .dmg file to be able to open. To troubleshoot this problem, do the following:

1. Go on System Preferences. 
2. Click Security and Privacy. 
3. Click the little lock symbol at the bottom and enter your mac password. 
4. Allow downloads from "App store and identified developers"
5. Try opening the file 

## Remotely Connecting 
**Step 1:** Open Terminal 

**Step 2:** make sure you are in your home directory 

**Step 3:** Type out the following command in the terminal 
`$ <your account name>@ieng6.ucsd.eduÂ `

**Step 4:** Enter your password (if you have one) 

**Step 5:** Hit enter. You should be able to see something like this:

You are now conneced remotely!

## Trying some commands
__cd__: change directory 

This command changes the directory from the one you are in to a different one so that you can execute other commands on a different directory and perform various functions such as viewing the contents of a different directory or opening a file in a different directory

__ls__: list files 

This command enables you to see all the files or directories contained in the directory you are currently in. 

__pwd__: print working directory 

This command gives you your current exact location on the computer

__mkdir__: make directory 

This command allows the user to create a directory (or in other words, a folder) in the directory you are currently in. 

__rm__: remove

Remove or rm is a prefix that you can use with other terms to delete a file or even a whole directory. This is an irreversible command.

__touch__: create a file

Touch can essentially allow you to make _any_ type of file, but it is initially empty. This blank file can then be opened in a tet editor. 

__man__: display command manual

## Moving Files with SCP 


## Setting the `SSH` key
