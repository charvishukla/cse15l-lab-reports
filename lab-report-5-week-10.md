## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to my lab report 5 for CSE 15L!


## TASK 1

**Explain how you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)**

## TASK 2 

**Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository , either is fine)**

## TASK 3

**Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output**

**Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output)**

**What it should produce**

**For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).**
